# Data Loading Python Workshop

Given a dataset of NBA players performance and salary in 2014, use Python to load the dataset and compute the summary statistics for the `SALARY` field:

- mean
- median
- mode
- minimum
- maximum

You will need to make use of the csv module or use pandas to load the data and interact with it. Computations should require only simple arithmetic.

**Bonus:**

Determine the relationship of PER (Player Efficiency Rating) to Salary via a visualization of the data.
